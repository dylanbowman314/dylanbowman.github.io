I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco. I work at [hud](https://www.hud.ai/) where I design evals and RL environments for frontier AI labs. I'm a card-carrying effective altruist which means I have a lot of unqualified opinions on AI and moral philosophy I'm eager to share.

Outside of work I mostly play guitar and scroll Twitter.
